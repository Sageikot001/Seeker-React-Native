Seeker is an intuitive job seeking mobile application with easy navigation and user experience. The task was to create the app and actually make it look trust worthy enough for users to be interested in using it.

-Knowledge of React Native is the first step here other wise we might not get anything done.
-A job search API would have to be implemented in other for the app to function as expected.
-Making the UI and the UX as intuitive as possible.
-Learning about the recent updates to expo 



Solution -React Native uses similar features as React so it isn't a difficult task to grab if you have a background in in React however, there are a few differences in syntax from React so recreating a project like this would require one to have a good knowledge of React Native. Thankfully I already have that.

-The Seeker app was to use a Job search API to fetch data of current real available jobs for seekers on the internet, so I used the J-search API from Rapid API to fetch the data. One of the reasons it isn't yet launched is that the free subscription on the API was used which only allows a hundred API calls in a month and that is way too small as one user actively job seeking could make over a 100 in a day, but regardless the entire system has been setup so if a paid version of the API is subscribed it can easily be integrated and set for launch.

-A good UX was necessary so I did my due diligence and eventually provided one for the project.

-Expo CLI is a really important part of a mobile build process. Recently they had made some updates to their systems which required some looking into as well, but overall it was a great experience. The project is ready and set for launch except for one or two updates before being published.
